Hello and welcome to the football_ai code.

In order to run the code install all modules in the requirements.txt

Then run the player_detection.py script to create a file which contains player coords.

Run draw_click_on_image.py and choose four corners witch double-click and confirm with "esc" button.

Now that the corners are defined you can map the original coords to the new coords in the rectangle by
running the map_player_coords_to_rectangle.py

In order to plot all points run the heatmap.py script. Choose first if you want to plot the original coords
or the mapped coords by specifying the path.
